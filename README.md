### 💖 My Story Behind This Portfolio

Building a portfolio might not be considered a “complex project” like some engineers take on, but I truly believe *it is a basic foundation that every engineer should have*.  

I was a little nervous about using *React, as I wasn’t fully comfortable with it. But I know that **React is extremely important in today’s tech world*, so I challenged myself to build this portfolio using React. Along the way, I incorporated:

- 💻 *React Components* to structure the pages  
- 🎨 *CSS Animations* for smooth hover effects and transitions  
- 🌐 *HTML & JavaScript* for interactivity  
- 💡 Various modern web development techniques  

I also plan to *deploy it live, so anyone can explore it online! This project has taught me a lot about combining **creativity with technology*, and I am really proud of how it turned out.
